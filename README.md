# The-eigenvalues-of-the-matrix-are-a-symmetric-algorithm
Task: To write in C++ with a graphical interface.
To develop a program for determining the eigenvalues of the matrix using a symmetric qr algorithm (method 8.2.3). Create a Sym QR class with attributes such as the dimension of the matrix, the matrix itself, a column of eigenvalues, and methods such as reading and checking the matrix for correctness, a symmetric Qr algorithm.
